# DCKAP Palli
**DCKAP பள்ளி** is an initiative by the DCKAP Community that strives to provide industry-ready skill training for the students who complete their **12th Grade/Polytechnic/Diploma colleges**. The training at DCKAP Palli happens through professionals from the community and industry experts.

DCKAP பள்ளி (Palli) focuses on recruiting Youth from underprivileged or low-income communities who can’t afford an expensive college education or are looking for alternative education to enter the corporate world. DCKAP பள்ளி (Palli) aims to mould students into well-rounded professionals ready to take up software jobs in our DCKAP Community after they are trained and made job-ready. We understand the need for students to settle down in their careers and we hope DCKAP Palli will not just uplift their life alone, but the whole family
